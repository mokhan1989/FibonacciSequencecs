A console application that outputs the first terms found in the Fibonacci sequence that do not exceed 4 million. 
The sum of all even terms found is calculated and displayed to the console. Compatible with .Net version 4.5 and upwards.

Output:

The terms found in the Fibonnaci Sequence are as follows: 
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181, 6765, 10946, 17711, 28657, 46368, 75025, 121393, 196418, 317811, 514229, 832040, 1346269, 2178309, 3524578

The sum of even-valued terms found in this sequence: 
2 + 8 + 34 + 144 + 610 + 2584 + 10946 + 46368 + 196418 + 832040 + 3524578 = 4613732
